# Light Bulb Example 

This example demonstrates how to register a customized ZCL On/Off light device with the Zigbee stack.

## Hardware Required

* One 802.15.4 enabled development board (e.g., ESP32-H2 or ESP32-C6) running this example.
* A second board running as Zigbee end device (see [customized_client](../customized_client) example)

## Configure the project

Before project configuration and build, make sure to set the correct chip target using `idf.py set-target TARGET` command.

## Erase the NVRAM 

Before flash it to the board, it is recommended to erase NVRAM if user doesn't want to keep the previous examples or other projects stored info 
using `idf.py -p PORT erase-flash`

## Build and Flash

Build the project, flash it to the board, and start the monitor tool to view the serial output by running `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor`.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

## Application Functions

- When the program starts, the board will register a `Customized` endpoint with the `On/Off Light` function and act as a Zigbee coordinator to form an open network
  within 180 seconds.

- If a Zigbee device joins this network and sends an `On/Off` command to the board, the LED on the board will be controlled accordingly.

- If the joined device sends a command to configure the `On/Off` attribute on the customized endpoint, the attribute will be reported based on the configuration.
