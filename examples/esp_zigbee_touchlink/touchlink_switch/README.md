# Touchlink Switch Example 

This example demonstrates how a Touchlink initiator can pair with a Touchlink target.

## Hardware Required
* One 802.15.4 enabled development board (e.g., ESP32-H2 or ESP32-C6) running this example.
* A second board running a Zigbee Touchlink target(Zigbee Router)(see [touchlink_light](../touchlink_light) example)

## Configure the project

Before project configuration and build, make sure to set the correct chip target using `idf.py set-target TARGET` command.

## Erase the NVRAM 

Before flash it to the board, it is recommended to erase NVRAM if user doesn't want to keep the previous examples or other projects stored info 
using `idf.py -p PORT erase-flash`

## Build and Flash

Build the project, flash it to the board, and start the monitor tool to view the serial output by running `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor`.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

## Application Functions

- When the program starts,tThe board, acting as the `Touchlink initiator`, will have the capability to scan nearby `Touchlink targets`.

- If no `Touchlink target` is found, the board will exit commissioning mode.
```

- If a `Touchlink target` is found, the board will pair with it and then exit commissioning mode.

```

- If the board is on a network, it will act as the `Home Automation On/Off Switch` and search for an `Home Automation  On/Off Light` device on the network.
  If found, it will bind the device to its binding table.
```
I (17397) ESP_TL_ON_OFF_SWITCH: Found light
I (17397) ESP_TL_ON_OFF_SWITCH: Try to bind on/off light
I (17407) ESP_TL_ON_OFF_SWITCH: Bound successfully!
```

- Once paired, pressing the `BOOT` button will trigger an `On/Off toggle` command to control the paired `On/Off Light` device.
```
