# OTA Upgrade Example 

This example demonstrates the whole OTA process from Zigbee OTA upgrade client side.

## Hardware Required

* One 802.15.4 enabled development board (e.g., ESP32-H2 or ESP32-C6) running this example.
* A second board running a Zigbee coordinator with OTA file (see [ota_server](../ota_server/) example)

## Configure the project

Before project configuration and build, set the correct chip target using `idf.py set-target TARGET` command.

## Erase the NVRAM 

Before flash it to the board, it is recommended to erase NVRAM if user doesn't want to keep the previous examples or other projects stored info 
using `idf.py -p PORT erase-flash`

## Build and Flash

Build the project, flash it to the board, and start the monitor tool to view the serial output by running `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor`.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

## Application Functions

- When the program starts, the board will attempt to detect an available Zigbee network every **1 second** until one is found.

```

- If the board is on a network, it acts as the Zigbee end device with the `OTA Upgrade Client` function.

- If an `Image Notify` request from the network is received by the board, a `Query Next Image` request will be sent to query the OTA image information.

```

- The `OTA example 2.0 is running` message indicates that the device has started up from the upgraded firmware.

- This board can initiate the `Query Next Image` request again  when the `BOOT` button on the board is pressed.

## Delta OTA Upgrade Functions

Compressed Delta OTA Updates aims at enabling Over-the-Air firmware update with compressed delta binaries. Instead of the complete binary to be hosted on the OTA update server, a patch file is hosted which is the difference between the base firmware and the new firmware in compressed form.

### Advantages

* Patch file have smaller size than the complete firmware file. This reduces the time and network usage to download the file from server.
* No additional storage partition is required for the "patch".
* Only firmware level changes are required. No bootloader related changes required.

### How to use the function

This example uses `esp_delta_ota` component which available though the [IDF component manager](https://components.espressif.com/component/espressif/esp_delta_ota). Please refer to its documentation for more details.

* Enable `ZB_DELTA_OTA` in menuconfig.
* Install required packages:

```
pip install -r managed_components/espressif__esp_delta_ota/examples/https_delta_ota/tools/requirements.txt
```

* Generate the upgrade file:
    * An old firmware as the base firmware which will flash into the device.
    * A new firmware to which we want to upgrade to.
    * Use the [python tool](./managed_components/espressif__esp_delta_ota/examples/https_delta_ota/tools/esp_delta_ota_patch_gen.py) create the patch file.

        ```
        python esp_delta_ota_patch_gen.py --chip <target> --base_binary <base_binary> --new_binary <new_binary> --patch_file_name <patch_file_name>
        ```

> **_NOTE:_** Make sure that the firmware present in the device is used as `base_binary` while creating the patch file. For this purpose, user should keep backup of the firmware running in the device as it is required for creating the patch file.

## OTA Upgrade Rate Optimization

Here are some ways to optimize the OTA upgrade rate:
- Adjust the `OTA_UPGRADE_MAX_DATA_SIZE` to improve frame exchange; a value of 223 is recommended.
- Increase `FREERTOS_HZ` in menuconfig to enhance the system's response rate. The default value is 100.
- Enable `IEEE802154_TIMING_OPTIMIZATION` in menuconfig to optimize IEEE802154 timing.
- Reduce unrelated logs during the OTA upgrade process.
